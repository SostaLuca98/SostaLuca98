### Hi there, nice to meet you! 👋

I am Luca Sosta, a Master's Degree student in Mathematical Engineering in the Computational Science and Computational Learning at Politecnico di Milano and former President of AIM - Associazione degli Ingegneri Matematici.

I would describe myself as a enthusiastic and curious person, always looking to new problems to solve.
I'm a fast learner who love working in team, in particular in association and long-term projects, where I can put all my experience and see the growth of my work.

My studies and master thesis are currently focused on ...
